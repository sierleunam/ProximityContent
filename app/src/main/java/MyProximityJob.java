     * Called to indicate that the job has begun executing.  Override this method with the
     * logic for your job.  Like all other component lifecycle callbacks, this method executes
     * on your application's main thread.
     * <p>
     * Return {@code true} from this method if your job needs to continue running.  If you
     * do this, the job remains active until you call
     * {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)} to tell the system that it has completed
     * its work, or until the job's required constraints are no longer satisfied.  For
     * example, if the job was scheduled using
     * {@link JobInfo.Builder#setRequiresCharging(boolean) setRequiresCharging(true)},
     * it will be immediately halted by the system if the user unplugs the device from power,
     * the job's {@link #onStopJob(JobParameters)} callback will be invoked, and the app
     * will be expected to shut down all ongoing work connected with that job.
     * <p>
     * The system holds a wakelock on behalf of your app as long as your job is executing.
     * This wakelock is acquired before this method is invoked, and is not released until either
     * you call {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)}, or after the system invokes
     * {@link #onStopJob(JobParameters)} to notify your job that it is being shut down
     * prematurely.
     * <p>
     * Returning {@code false} from this method means your job is already finished.  The
     * system's wakelock for the job will be released, and {@link #onStopJob(JobParameters)}
     * will not be invoked.
     *
     * @param params Parameters specifying info about this job, including the optional
     *               extras configured with {@link JobInfo.Builder#setExtras(PersistableBundle).
     *               This object serves to identify this specific running job instance when calling
     *               {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)}.
     * @return {@code true} if your service will continue running, using a separate thread
     * when appropriate.  {@code false} means that this job has completed its work.

     * idle maintenance window. You are solely responsible for the behavior of your application
     * upon receipt of this message; your app will likely start to misbehave if you ignore it.

     * this job based on the retry criteria provided at job creation-time; or {@code false}
     * to end the job entirely.  Regardless of the value returned, your job must stop executing.
